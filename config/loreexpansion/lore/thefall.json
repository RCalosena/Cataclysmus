I remember feeling a cold breeze gently swirling around my face… calling me -- reminding me… of home... 

I've risen in a gentle forest, unaware of how I got in this peaceful place… Yet I can't help but find peace within this queer awakening. I had a deep appreciation of it. I stood to get the most out of the graceful smell of the leaves and flowers, and the gentle breeze sliding against my body and pushing me west.

All possesions of mine are gone, barring my journal, nothing else. And I do feel a strange post bludgeoning pain, on the back of my head, and in my left arm. It looks swollen too, as if I had fallen somewhere high, tumbling down a tree before falling diagonally in a way that struck both my head and arm… But it musn't be the gravest of things. I'm able to move my arm, and maybe the strike on the head just gave me slight amnesia... I'll be fine. I just have to take care and let myself heal... 

Meanwhile, I will wonder about through the trees.",
