    "body": "Today, humanity has fallen. Breaches emerged and disfigured the sky, and cruel, reckless monsters started pouring out, so excessively that it looked like flowing water from raging rivers.
    I used to live in a small village. We called it Natúr… heh… at least I can confidently believe that it will finally become part of mother nature again… They destroyed everything… They took everything… But nature still reigns over all.
    
    Our hearts are strong, our determination is unreachable by these monsters, but they outnumber us, and they are a lot stronger. Let me just say, that to me, hope is lost. Humanity… is… lost. Don't even bother… We already lost.
  
    Today is my last day on Nature's Grace. The Rift is hiding from the rising sun… our failed-to-bring back familiars, are burning in the light… and promptly… I'll be burning with them. The birds are singing, the grass is flourishing, and I can feel the soft wind, brushing my hair, trying to move my body, even though it is not strong enough to do so. 
  huh, even nature herself wants me to stand up and keep fighting. But my wounds are unfixable. I'd rather stay in the outpost I chose to spend my last days on… and spend my last minute… writing this to myself. 
    Goodbye my beautiful Nature's Grace…
