    "body": "Today, I’ll succumb to my fate and for once, rest. My wounds are far too incurable and my will to fight has faded away. my fate… is sealed by the Dungeon Keepers.

    If any other hero manages to read this before “they” burn it, I want you to suffer not, the outcome that I experienced. The Dungeon Keeper that I failed to kill is one with a dark hoodie on him, but once he shows his face, he shall call himself “The Necromancer”. He will continuously attempt to cast magic on you, which will many times mean that your sheer armor won’t be enough to endure his power. Nonetheless, these are the spells that I saw him casting upon me:
    
    Spell #1 (Summoning): It is possible that He might use his magic to cast pentagrams on the floor. This will indicate where his minions will spawn. They will be undead skeletons which will vary in equipment.
    
    Spell #2 (Shooting): In between the times where he casts spells, he will shoot you with his wand. These projectiles are slow, but they damage through your very armor.
    
    Spell #3 (Crocodile Heads): He will sometimes make a barrage of crocodile heads appear from the floor in his radius, make sure to keep your distance.
    
    Spell #4 (Explosive Heads): His most powerful attack summons flying skeleton heads that will explode when they make contact with you.
    
    May god be on your side, and I hope you carry the fate of Nature's Grace in your caring arms… I wḯ̷͚͊̔̌-- --- ---
