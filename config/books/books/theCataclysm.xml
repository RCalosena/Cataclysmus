These ores are both found at around y=30 to y=10 inside the Deep Caverns, meaning that you'll have to travel to the very bottom of the cave systems to find these ores. Besides that, there is another important ore that is found in that height level, being the Carbon Didýmite Ore <stack item="ebwizardry:crystal_ore"/> , which drops <link scale="1.15" ref="ByS:qualities">devout crystals</link><stack item="ebwizardry:magic_crystal"/> when mined. Also, at any height level, you'll find Lapis Lazuli ore <stack item="minecraft:lapis_ore"/> , which is also absent in the regular caverns.</p>
      <p scale="1.15">Finally, you might notice a variety of other ores while exploring the Deep Caverns. Many of these ores are ones that you'll have to mine in the future for progression. So, if you are able to obtain them beforehand, feel free to do so.</p>

      <p space="8">As you probably noticed through your time playing this game, the Diamond Pickaxe now has two alternative recipes which require a special material that you might not know how to obtain. As stated before, these materials are ones that are dropped by bosses.</p>
      <p space="8">This time, you can choose which boss to fight as now you'll have to summon them by performing certain actions.</p>

      <p space="8" underline="true">The Grim Reaper</p>
      <p space="8">If you're looking for a rather short fight, you might want to choose The Grim Reaper.</p>
      <p space="8">As opposed to The Skeleton King, The Grim Reaper is strong and nimble, meaning that, on top of him dealing a lot of damage, it'll be harder for you to hit him in battle.</p>
      <p space="8">Besides the incredible agility of the boss, there are no other tricks to this fight besides a phase where the boss teleports to the air and starts healing, in which case, you'll have to tower up into the air to reach him.</p>
      <p space="8" underline="true">The Skeleton King</p>
      <p space="8">If you're looking for a more long lasting yet tamer fight, you might want to choose The Skeleton King.</p>
      <p space="8">As opposed to The Grim Reaper, The Skeleton King is slow yet resistant, meaning that you can focus on damaging while dodging pretty easily, but the fight might go on for a while.</p>
      <p space="8">During the fight, you might want to focus on taking out The Skeleton King's minions every once in a while, as they might throw off your rhythm, and also, as they spawn progressively during the fight, they could start accumulating and becoming a serious problem.</p>
      <p space="12" underline="true" scale="1.2">Step 3: Preparing for the fight</p>
      <p space="8">For the first time in the game, you'll be able to choose between two armors that represent two subclasses (for more information click <link ref="ByS:pickClass">here</link>). A small guide on how to adquire the materials to craft these armors, can be seen below:</p>

      <p space="12" underline="true" scale="1.2">Step 4: Summoning the Bosses</p>
      <p space="8" underline="true">The Grim Reaper</p>
      <p space="8">To summon The Grim Reaper, you'll need to make an altar with some obsidian and an emerald block. Obtaining/handling obsidian will be more tricky than normal, as you don't have a diamond pickaxe to mine it. Instead, you can acquire it through mobs like the Reapers, which randomly spawn when sleeping or killing passive mobs, or, alternatively, you can use water and lava buckets to create obsidian blocks.</p>
      <p space="8">To make the summoning altar, place 3 obsidian columns that are atleast 2 blocks high, and an emerald block in between.</p>
      <p space="8">The summoning altar for the Grim Reaper has to be made in the following arrangement:</p>
      <p space="8" indent="8">(the symbol "<image src="minecraft:blocks/grass_top" tw="10" th="10"/>" represents the ground, which can be any block)</p>

      <p space="8">Afterward, to summon the boss, wait until night and then light the top of all the pillars with fire, before lighting the emerald block as well. After doing so, the emerald block will be consumed, and the Grim Reaper will spawn.</p>
      <p space="8" underline="true">The Skeleton King</p>
      <p space="8">To summon The Skeleton King, you'll have to get your hands on a skeleton skull <stack item="minecraft:skull"/>, which is found in different structures around the world, and a King's Crown <stack item="mod_lavacow:kings_crown"/>, which can be either found on desert structures called "Desert Tombs", or dropped by the OsVermis, which is a mob that spawns in sandy biomes.</p>

      <p space="15">Finally For Scoped Overseer, also go to the nether, but to find Kalendrite ores <stack item="metallurgy:kalendrite_ore"/> at around y=120 to y=27.</p>
      <p space="12" underline="true" scale="1.2">Step 2: Better Tools/Weapons</p>
      <p space="8">Once obtaining the armor needed to survive in the Nether, you should focus on upgrading your weapons past diamond. In this case, melee weapons that deal more than 7 damage would be the Vulcanite ones. Besides that, there are some other weapons made from other metals, which can be used as "side" weapons, and alternatively, you can craft the Lesser Equipment Forge, allowing you to make weaponry using monster parts. Regardless of what you decide to use, make sure to be prepared for the first Nether boss, which will be the Wither.</p>

      <p space="8">This boss is the same as vanilla minecraft's, the only difference being that you're forced to fight it inside the Nether. In terms of move sets, The Wither will now summon a few minions during the fight, but the general strategies to defeat it remain the same.</p>
      <p space="8">Once killed, The Wither drops (10) Nether Stars <stack item="minecraft:nether_star"/> instead of 1, which you'll use to make the next tier of armor for your class, and a new tier of weapons made of nether stars. Furthermore, note that the fight will become harder every time you kill the Wither.</p>
      <p space="12" underline="true" scale="1.2">Step 2: Armors</p>
      <p space="8">Upon defeating the Wither, you'll have Nether Stars <stack item="minecraft:nether_star"/> which as stated before, are used to make better armor. Now, see the other materials for crafting them below.</p>
      <p space="15">For Hell for Leather, make Desichalkos dust <stack item="metallurgy:desichalkos_dust"/> using the following recipe:</p>

      <p space="8">Finally, for Scoped Overseer, revisit The Deep Caverns once more to get Carmot ores <stack item="metallurgy:carmot_ore"/>, found at around y=30 to y=10 (note: you can't break Carmot ore without a better mining tool, like the Desichalkos pickaxe).</p>

      <p space="8">In the Nether, there will be many giant dungeons that are recommended to be explored right after defeating the Wither, and making your new equipment. These dungeons contain, in some rooms, a mini boss that drops a material called the "Soul Stone", which will summon permanent pets/mounts when right-clicked that will aid you through the rest of your adventure.</p>

      <p space="8">Previous bosses were meant to be small obstacles to overcome with some quick preparations, but the Super Bosses will be big events that you'll have to heavily prepare yourself for. The first Super Boss will be Rahovart, which is the final boss of the Nether.</p>
      <p>To summon Rahovart, you'll need to make an altar using obsidian <stack item="minecraft:obsidian"/>, diamond blocks <stack item="minecraft:diamond_block"/> and a block called the Demonic Soulcube <stack item="lycanitesmobs:soulcubedemonic"/>.</p>

      <p space="8">The altar is constructed by placing (4) obsidian columns being (3) blocks high, with a diamond block on top of each. All columns will be surrounding a middle column made of (4) obsidian blocks with the Demonic Soulcube in the middle.</p>

      <p space="12" underline="true" scale="1.2">Step 2: The Fight</p>
      <p space="8" underline="true">Phase 1</p>
      <p space="8">In the first stage of the fight, Rahovart shoots some projectiles while also spawning Belphegors. The idea is to damage the boss while also killing the Belphegors because if enough remain in the arena, Rahovart will unleash a wave of fire that deals lots of damage. Also, have fire resistance on hand, or equip the Obsidian Relic <stack item="bountifulbaubles:trinketobsidianskull"/> for the fight as the arena might slowly fill up with fire, which could spell your demise if you don't bring protection for it.</p>
      <p space="8" underline="true">Phase 2</p>
      <p space="8">Eventually, after dealing enough damage, the fight reaches its second phase. This time, ignore the Belphegors because now, you'll have to focus on killing Behemophets, which will start spawning in this phase. As before, if enough Behemophets remain in the arena, Rahovart makes a special attack. This time he will create giant walls of fire that rotate around him, which can kill you very quickly.</p>
      <p space="8" underline="true">Phase 3</p>
      <p space="8">Finally, once reaching the last stage, Rahovart will spawn a variety of mobs which are all supposed to be killed to prevent him from making his next move. But eventually, the spawn rate of the mobs might become overwhelming and impossible to control. Because of this, you'll have to deal as much damage as possible to the boss before he fills the entire arena with his giant walls of fire, which will progressively spawn until the arena is completely covered by them.</p>

One ender eye will launch towards the stronghold. After so, walk towards where the ender eye pointed, while throwing some more every couple hundred blocks, until the eye flies into the ground, showing that you've found the Stronghold, usually buried underground.</p>

Upon placing the last eye, the portal will activate, letting you jump through.</p>

      <p space="8" underline="true">No avaliable armors during this stage.</p>
      <p space="12" underline="true" scale="1.2">Step 1: The Arena</p>
      <p space="8">The Ender Dragon fight will be harder this time. The first thing to notice is that the arena is no longer filled with Ender men, instead being full of Eyedrudens. To try and avoid getting jumpscared, try to fill as much of the landscape with lights as possible, to prevent them from getting near, and try to tower up two blocks every time you stand still, to prevent them from reaching you. Also, beware of other monsters that might spawn, as they deal a lot of damage and some might even push you off your tower.</p>
      <p space="12" underline="true" scale="1.2">Step 2: The Pillars</p>
      <p space="8">To prevent the Ender Dragon from healing, you'll have to destroy crystals in the top of all the pillars in the arena as well as some Ender men structures. Try to use arrows for this to avoid getting pushed off from a high place by the Ender Dragon.</p>
      <p space="12" underline="true" scale="1.2">Step 3: Hurting the Dragon</p>
      <p space="8">If you're using arrows to hurt the dragon, you'll notice that due to darkness, the Ender Dragon is much harder to spot, but not impossible (bring Night Vision if possible). Also, every time you hit the dragon with an arrow, it'll roll away from you, sometimes even preventing it from reaching the middle of the arena. So if you're a melee player, avoid hitting the dragon with arrows. You'll have a much higher damage output if you hit the dragon with your melee weapons once it comes to the middle of the arena (note: get as much Dragon Breath as possible, as it'll be useful for the future).</p>
    </section>
    <section condition="guide8">
      <p space="12" underline="true" scale="1.2">Step 4: The Defeat</p>
      <p space="8">After defeating the Ender Dragon, it'll drop scales all around the arena. Try to bring Night Vision to spot the scales much easier, and collect the egg that spawns in the middle as it'll be useful for the creation of a powerful bauble. Finally, after the defeat, you'll be able to re-summon the Ender Dragon normally, except that, every time you kill it, the fight will get harder. Just like with the Wither.</p>

      <p space="12" underline="true" scale="1.2">Step 1: What is This Place?</p>
      <p space="8">Upon entering the Hidden World, you'll notice its expansive foliage that extends through miles. But as inviting as it might look, it's full of dangers. Big, multi-legged and disgusting dangers.</p>
      <p space="8">Before venturing too far, try to mark your location or memorize your starting place as to not get lost and resort to digging up and out into possible dangers.</p>
      <p space="12" underline="true" scale="1.2">Step 2: Arthropods and Parasites</p>
      <p space="8">Before starting your trip to explore and acquire as much materials as possible, it's good to know what you'll be facing in this dimension. The first being giant insects. Most, if not all these insects have unique drops that will help you create new weapons and other useful items. Some are hostile and others are passive, but they'll all have a lot of health and will pack a great punch, so be careful while fighting.</p>
      <p space="8">Lastly, you'll have to worry about what is likely the most dangerous mobs in the game, which are parasites. These creatures will occasionally spawn in the Hidden World, but most importantly, they will evolve. These creatures will start to get more dangerous over time, meaning that once you enter the Hidden World, there's no turning back when it comes to the difficulty of the game.</p>
      <p space="12" underline="true" scale="1.2">Step 3: Jade Weaponry</p>
      <p space="8">One of the main things to look for in this dimension, is a material called Jade<stack item="erebus:materials" meta="1"/>. It spawns as an ore all around the erebus from y=5 to y=112, but can also be found in chests all around the Hidden World. This material will help you make better weapons than the ones you currently have.</p>

      <p space="8">Remember the quest to find the boss dungeons in the Overworld? This time, you'll have to do the same in the Hidden world. But just with two dungeons.</p>
      <p space="12" underline="true" scale="1.2">Step 2: The Search</p>
      <p space="8" underline="true"> Antlion Overlord's Pyramid:</p>
      <p space="8">This dungeon is almost garanteed to spawn in the Volcanic Desert biome. Although most times half-buried, it's possible for it to spawn completely buried underground, which makes its finding much harder. For a reference, you can use the health bars that appear in your screen, to guide your way into it.</p>
    </section>
    <section condition="guide13">
      <p space="8" underline="true"> Giant Eucalyptus Trees:</p>
      <p space="8">This dungeon will rarely spawn in the Ulterior Outback biome, which is the most dangerous biome in the Hidden World.</p>
      <p space="12" underline="true" scale="1.2">Step 3: Incecticide</p>
      <p space="8">After finding the dungeons, you'll have to venture yourself into rooms that will eventually lead you to the Bosses. To ensure you don't get lost, there is a small tutorial on how to get to the bosses below.</p>
      <p space="8" underline="true"> Antlion Overlord:</p>
      <p space="8">Once entering the Dungeon, you'll notice a pyramid that can't be accessed. This is where the Antlion Overlord resides. To open the pyramid, kill all four minibosses located at every corner of the labyrinth around the pyramid (Tip: hug either the right or left wall of the labyrinth while traveling). Each Idol Guardian (miniboss) will drop their respective item, of which you'll place at the top of the pyramid to open it.</p>
      <p space="8">The Interior of the pyramid contains a chest with (8) Jades in it, and an inactive Teleport Pad surrounded by eight blocks topped with the icon of Jade. Insert each of the Jade gems into those slots, and the Teleport Pad will open. Stepping on it will take you to the floor below. Then, for the following teleporters, you'll need (8) of Exoskeleton Plates, Magma Cream, Magma Crawler Eyes and strings, respectfully.</p>
      <p space="8">The last teleporter in the pyramid will make the forcefields around it break, therefore allowing access to the big teleporter in the middle, that will take you to the fight. The bossfight itself doesn't have any special tricks, so you'll figure it out quickly.</p>
      <p space="8" underline="true"> Tarantula Brood Mother:</p>
      <p space="8">This dungeon contains several Tarantula spawners that are surrounded by cobwebs. These spawners will be seen in multiple floors before the arena of the Tarantula Brood Mother.</p>
    </section>
    <section condition="guide13">
      <p space="8">The bossfight is quite simple, but intense. The Tarantula Brood Mother will summon several baby Tarantulas that will chase you around, and you won't be able to hit her with any melee weapon through the first phase. After so, the second phase will be the opposite, so make sure to bring ranged and melee weapons to the fight.</p>
      <p space="12" underline="true" scale="1.2">Step 4: Aftermath</p>
      <p space="8">As always, there will be a better tier of armor awaiting for each class after the defeat of these bosses. See them below.</p>

      <p space="8" underline="true">Phase 1</p>
      <p space="8">Amalgalich will summon Reapers and will sometimes start trying to suck everything up, which if you don't resist, will instantly kill you. Any Reapers consumed will also heal the Amalgalich. Be sure to run away when its eyes light up and try not to leave many Reapers alive. It's important not to jump or fly when Amalgalich uses this attack, since the pulling power is stronger if not in the ground.</p>
      <p space="8" underline="true">Phase 2</p>
      <p space="8">Amalgalich will stop trying to eat. Instead, Geists and giant Epions are summoned. Overtime, the Geists will grow until then eventually bursting into large areas of Shadowfire (killing the Geists before they pop will prevent this). If there's too much Shadowfire, killing the Epions will clear it beneath them. Try to keep the arena clear for Phase 3.</p>
      <p space="8" underline="true">Phase 3</p>
      <p space="8">Finally, in this last phase, Amalgalich will start sucking things up again. Also, this time, giant balls of Darklings are lobbed around the arena. Keep the Darklings at bay and just damage the boss without getting eaten. If there are too many Geists or Epions left from Phase 2, Amalgalich will eat these to regain health, possibly putting it back into Phase 2.</p>
      <p space="8" bold="true">As always, Good luck. You're gonna need it.</p>

      <p scale="1.15">Before starting your playthrough, it's important to state some basic features that will be present throughout the entire game.</p>

        <title scale="1.15">Skill Trees</title>
      </page_title>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">The game has two skill trees accessed by keybinds found in your controls.</p>
      <p space="20" scale="1.15">All details about these skill trees can be seen below:</p>
      <p color="#5700ad" align="center" space="8" underline="true" scale="1.5">Knowledge of Death:</p>
      <p align="center"><image src="tombstone:gui/knowledge" tw="80" th="80"/></p>
      <p align="center" scale="4" bold="true">--------</p>
      <p space="15" scale="1.15">This skill tree improves the player's abilities related to death, stealth, and other features. Points are earned through advancements, soul enchanting, and other methods listed in the GUI's "Compendium" section. The GUI also provides additional information on the the mechanics and abilities of this skill tree. To access the GUI, set a keybind in the controls menu.</p>
      <p color="#ad00ad" align="center" space="8" underline="true" scale="1.5">Armament Leveling System:</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">There's a built-in leveling system for weapons/armors, where they gain experience and level up as you use them. The points earned can be used to unlock special abilities through the armament leveling keybind ("k" by default). These abilities require spending player xp to unlock as well.</p>

        <title>Classes</title>
      </page_title>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">The modpack has four classes to choose from. Classes are determined by the armor sets you wear, with each class having unique strengths, weaknesses, and strategies that will define your playstyle and path in the adventure.</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">All classes with their description can be found below:</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">For nimble players: <link scale="1.15" ref=":hellForLeather">
        Hell for Leather</link></p>

      <page_title>
        <title color="#00a627" scale="1.15">Hell for Leather</title>
      </page_title>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">This class has been designed to be the fastest, stealthiest and most damage dealing at the expense of defense, which will force you to use your agility to survive. This class has no toughness and the least armor points in relation to the other classes. you will also keep all your dodges with this class, further improving your mobility. Finally, the class also has subclasses. Their description is seen below:</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.5" underline="true" color="#00a627">Brisk Rogue:</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">This subclass enhances the player's attack speed to assist with crowd control, with a slight damage nerf. The subclass also makes mobs get pushed back when attacking.</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.5" underline="true" color="#00a627">Death Rogue:</p>
      <p space="15" scale="1.15">This subclass prioritizes high damage output at the expense of lower attack speed, making it more effective against individual targets instead of crowds. The subclass also increases the player's reach, allowing to avoid enemy attacks from getting too close.</p>
      <p align="center"><image src="behgameon:items/accessory_47" tw="80" th="80"/><image src="behgameon:items/accessory_45" tw="80" th="80"/></p>

    <section condition="default" id="heavyWarrior">
      <page_title>
        <title color="#ad7900" scale="1.15">Heavy Warrior</title>
      </page_title>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">The Heavy Warrior class was created for those who are already satisfied with the complexity of vanilla Minecraft. This class has high armor points and toughness, but no other benefits except for a slight increase in damage. The subclass system is simple, allowing players to choose between armors with more toughness or more armor points.</p>
      <p space="30" scale="1.15"> Observation: The Heavy Warrior class doesn't get any dodges by default, but is able to use them with the help of the "LightWeight" enchantment.</p>
      <p align="center"><image src="behgameon:items/accessory_49" tw="80" th="80"/><image src="behgameon:items/accessory_46" tw="80" th="80"/></p>

        <title color="#009fad" scale="1.15">Scoped Overseer</title>
      </page_title>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">This class falls between Hell for Leather and Heavy Warrior in terms of defense, but excels in long-range combat with a bonus to projectile damage. The subclasses offer unique ways to achieve this damage. See below for more details.</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.5" underline="true" color="#009fad">Close Combat Archer:</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">This subclass uses the vanilla bow and arrow mechanics, with greater melee range but weaker damage. It's also designed to be effective against large groups of enemies, just like "Brisk Rogue", using the speed to maintain distance rather than outright killing foes. The subclass also has a strong dodge ability every 20 seconds for retreating and allowing long-range combat.</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.5" underline="true" color="#009fad">Keen Eyes:</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">This subclass changes the player's attack style, boosting projectile damage at the expense of focus. It creates a semi-permanent damage decrease effect, which will appear in the top right of your screen. Eventually, the effect will disappear for half a second, allowing for high damage output during that time. Additionally, a short-term damage buff also appears at random, testing the player's reflexes. This subclass demands the most focus to use due to the need to manage effect timers.</p>

        <title color="#870f0f" scale="1.15">Devout Mage</title>
      </page_title>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">This class opens the door to a very complex section of the game, involving magic. The class focuses on increasing the player's magic damage to allow for the expansive set of spells to be used as main weapons. This class also has a set of subclasses that are simple, but greatly change your playstyle. Descriptions can be seen below:</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.5" underline="true" color="#870f0f">Warlock:</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">This subclass greatly increases Magic Damage. You also get a different potion effect depending on the wand held, and by default, you get +100 MP.</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.5" underline="true" color="#870f0f">Necromancer:</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">With this subclass, you get the “Necromancer” potion effect which allows you to use summoning staffs. Magic damage is also increased but by about half of Warlock. Finally, Hurting enemies heals you and all your armor points are replaced with hearts.</p>

      <image src="minecraft:items/diamond_sword" tw="50" th="50"/>
      <p> </p>

      <p space="8" scale="1.15">In the game, you can dodge by pressing "alt" or double-tapping any direction key except forwards. Dodges shoot you in the direction you're moving, with varying strength based on potions and dimension. You'll move half a block higher with half a second of invincibility. Dodges aren't usable while blocking with a shield.</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">Dodges consume 'feathers' from your hotbar (shown as (10) feathers). Air dodges use 1.5 feathers, while ground dodges use 1 feather.</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">Hunger also affects your ability to dodge, making it impossible to do so if you have only five hunger points left.</p>
      <p space="10" bold="true" underline="true" scale="1.15">Weight:</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">Wearing specific armor sets disables feathers due to added weight. To avoid this, use Hell for Leather class armor or apply "Lightweight" enchantments on your gear to reduce weight.</p>

      <p space="8" scale="1.15">Jump while pressed onto a wall, then crouch. This will make you grip onto the surface of the block. Then, look in the opposite direction and release your crouch button to jump off the wall!</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">Wall jumps enable you to clear two-block heights, scale parallel structures, and avoid fall damage.</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">Clinging into a wall for too long will make you slide down it.</p>
      <p space="10" underline="true" bold="true" scale="1.2">Hunger:</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">Hunger has been revamped. Eating food grants a "Well Fed" effect that scales with food quality, providing increased healing. Smaller foods like berries offer minimal health regeneration but are quicker to consume than larger meals.</p>
      <p space="10" bold="true" underline="true" scale="1.15">Morsels n' Meals:</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">Food items will now have tooltips indicating their meal quality. The lowest is a "Morsel" and the highest is a "Large Meal." If a food is "Hearty," it has excellent saturation, making the best option a "Hearty Large Meal."</p>

      <p space="10" underline="true" bold="true" scale="1.2">Attack Speed:</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">The revamped attack speed mechanics now require waiting for the cooldown to fully expire before attacking. This allows for balanced weapons with lower attack speed but higher damage. The improved immunity-frame system enables faster attacks on mobs without prolonged immunity, promoting team ambushes and higher attack speeds.</p>
      <p space="10" underline="true" bold="true" scale="1.2">Shield Blocking:</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">Shields have a cooldown when hit, based on the weapon's damage. To avoid this, perform a parry by blocking right before getting attacked. This allows you to block again without a cooldown.</p>
      <p space="10" underline="true" bold="true" scale="1.2">Head Shots:</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">Headshots are a new feature in ranged weapons. Aim for the top of the monster's body. Headshots deal significant damage to the target's helmet, if worn.</p>

      <p space="10" align="center" underline="true" bold="true" scale="1.5">Stealth:</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">The game features stealth mechanics such as crouching, hiding in the dark, using invisibility potions, being without armor, staying still, or positioning yourself behind mobs. There's also a light meter on the bottom left of your screen that lets you know your current light level.</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">Monsters can have effects like Soulsight or Glowing to spot you more easily, or Blindness to spot you less easily. Some monsters have better vision in dark places and will spawn if you stay in the dark for too long.</p>
      <p space="10" bold="true" underline="true" scale="1.15">Crosshair:</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">The crosshair now appears regardless of the player's perspective change ("f5"). It also serves as an indicator when mobs spot you, transforming into an eye. However, the eye has various animations, so if it's not fully open, the monster may not have seen you yet.</p>
      <p space="10" bold="true" underline="true" scale="1.15">Sneaking:</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">With the new stealth system, you can perform a 'Stealth Strike' on enemies, multiplying your damage by 1.5. This stacks with Critical Strikes. Be cautious, as mobs can also perform Stealth Strikes on you. If you manage to kill an entity with a Stealth Strike, you'll trigger an 'Assassination' and gain Strength and Invisibility buffs briefly, aiding you in claiming another victim.</p>
      <p space="8" scale="1.15">Finally, monsters will now flee from a battle if they are left at roughly 1% of their original health. If they flee and calm down, they'll get a Regeneration V buff. If they happen to heal while fleeing, they'll get a Resistance III buff.</p>
