# The-Cataclysm
Source code of the survival modpack (-The Cataclysm-).

The Cataclysm is an intense survival pack that combines the best features from various video game genres like Horror, RPG, Roguelikes, PVP-focused games, and story-focused games. It aims to create a unique and immersive experience that doesn't lose its appeal as you progress, and also, it's not solely focused on ultra-realistic survival elements but instead emphasizes mechanics that remain and work together to offer something distinct.

This modpack offers a better separation of minecraft's different difficulty modes, catering to both those seeking a milder experience and those looking for a VERY HARD challenge. Unlike vanilla Minecraft, the modpack maintains a constant, sometimes progressively scaling difficulty. Increasing when defeating specific bosses rather than over time, allowing for a sustainable multiplayer experience with friends. And while many modpacks associate difficulty with frustration, this one actively tries to dive into skill-based challenges rather than relying on random events or annoying survival mechanics.
